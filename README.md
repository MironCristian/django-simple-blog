Django Simple Blog

A full-stack web application, built with the Python Django framework.
This project serves as a demonstration of understanding and applying fundamental web development concepts, including the MVT architecture, ORM, and routing.

Project Architecture

The project follows Django’s Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture:

Model (blog/models.py): Defines the data structure (Post with title, content, and date). This acts as the “blueprint” for the database.

View (blog/views.py): Contains the business logic. These functions handle HTTP requests, query the database using Django’s ORM, and pass data to the templates.

Template (blog/templates/): Represents the presentation layer. HTML files use Django Template Language to dynamically render the data received from the view.

Implemented Features

List of all blog posts on the homepage, sorted in descending order by creation date.

Post detail page accessible via dynamic URLs (e.g., /post/1/).

Admin interface automatically generated by Django to manage posts (CRUD operations – Create, Read, Update, Delete) without writing additional backend code.

Applied Technologies

Backend: Python, Django

Database: SQLite3 (through Django ORM, without writing raw SQL)

Frontend: HTML, Django Template Language

Version Control: Git, GitHub

How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/MironCristian/django-simple-blog.git
cd django-simple-blog


Create and activate a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Apply database migrations:
This will create the db.sqlite3 file and set up the required tables.

python manage.py migrate


(Optional) Create a superuser to access the admin panel:

python manage.py createsuperuser


Run the application:

python manage.py runserver


The app will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/, and the admin panel at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/.
